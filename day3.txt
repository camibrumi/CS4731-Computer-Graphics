points, scalars, vectors
linear combination or blend (fancy word for barycentric coordinates)

dot product
how much is a alike b?
a.b

angle < 90 b.c > 0
      =        = 0
      >        <


in computer graphics: all the vectors start at the origin

affine combination
all components sum up to 1 and all the coefficients are non-negative
this forms the convex affine space

these are the barycentric coordinates

coordinate system for the triangle can be the same one as the one for rasterizatiion

we know x and y and l1 + l2 + l3 = 1

we can solve for l1, l2 and l3

afterwards we can use the method we've seen to test whether a point is in the triangle


the view port it the one who translates from the interval (-1, 1) x, y coordinates to the coordinates from (0,0) to (400,400) (positive coordinates)
