tranasformations on our triangles

rotate, scale, translates


translating: does not depend where the triangle is centered.
scaling: it depends on the initial position (in order to do a correct scaling without deformation)
multiplying by a negative scalar >> reflection

xf = x0*cos(0) - y0*sin(0)

IF SHAPE NOT CENTERD IN THE ORIGIN: we translate it to the origin, we rotate it, and we translate it back
